### What's for Dinner?

This app allows the user to decide what to make for dinner!  There are four options a user can select: side, main, dessert, or entire meal.  Selecting one and pushing the button will create a random meal.  Selecting the entire meal option will generate a full meal consisting of a main dish, side and dessert.  After a meal is generated the user has the option to clear the screen and start over.
